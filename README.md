This Script is a fully automatic Cobblestone Farmer (using a Cobblestone-Generator on your private world) which after x stacks of enchanted cobblestone warps to the hub, walks to the Bazaar-NPC and sells the entire inventory.
To be able to use this script yourself you need to do the following things:
1. Have a fully functional Cobblestone-Generator
2. Set your home at the Start of the Cobblestone-Generator using /sethome
3. Change the mouse position to match your screen
4. Have a Stonk + Silverfish-Pet
5. Install the Minescript modpack found here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minescript/files
6. Put the .py file into the same path as the config.txt file
7. Have all imports installed (if you dont use pip install)


Troubleshooting if import minescript is yellow underlined:
It doesnt matter if its yellow underlined it just meaans that the library of minescript is not added as a path if u still want to have it removed add a path to the library located in the mod itself
In VS-Code: Ctrl + , opens the settings. From there on go to Pylance and add the path of the library.

Have fun getting free money while u do anything else :)
